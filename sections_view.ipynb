SFA, profunda, popliteal, and peroneal embolectomy.\\n2. Placement of sheath into the common femoral artery,\\n    third order vessel.\\n3. Left lower extremity angiogram.\\n\\nINDICATIONS:  This is a ___ gentleman who is a\\nchronic smoker and has a history of hypertension and coronary\\nartery disease but who is noncompliant with his medical care\\nwho presented to an outside hospital complaining of acute\\nonset of pain, numbness, and weakness of his left lower\\nextremity.  He was transferred to our institution out of\\nconcern of acute limb ischemia.  CTA was performed here which\\nshowed a short segment 3 cm SFA occlusion and no\\nvisualization of contrast below the left popliteal artery.\\nThe risks, benefits, and alternatives of femoral cutdown and\\nembolectomy were explained to the patient, specifically the\\nhigh risk of limb loss or need for fasciotomy and the patient\\nagreed to the procedure and signed informed consent.\\n\\nDETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the hybrid\\nroom and placed on the OR table in supine position.  Both\\ngroins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\\nA time-out was performed identifying the correct patient,\\nsite of operation and procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics\\nwere given.  We began by making a longitudinal incision over\\nthe left common femoral artery which was easily palpable,\\ndissection was carried down, and we easily dissected out the\\ncommon femoral artery, the SFA, and the profunda.  Vessel\\nloops were placed around each of these to gain proximal and\\ndistal control.  ___ clamp was placed on\\nthe common femoral artery and after giving a bolus of 3000\\nunits of heparin.  \\n\\nNext an arteriotomy was made in the common femoral artery just\\nproximal to the profunda using an 11 blade.  This was extended\\nwith Potts scissors.  A ___ ___ balloon was passed down the\\nSFA and a good deal of thrombus was extracted.  This was \\nrepeated\\nuntil no further clot could be retrieved.  The same was done \\nwith\\nthe profunda and again thrombus was retrieved.  Next we used a \\n___\\n___ catheter and passed this down into what we believed was\\nthe peroneal. We did not get any clot back when this was done \\nand\\nlastly we passed a ___ ___ catheter proximally into the\\nexternal iliac artery.  No clot was retrieved and we observed\\nexcellent inflow.  \\n\\nAt this point, we partially closed the arteriotomy with ___\\nProlene but before tying down the knot we inserted a sheath into\\nthe common femoral artery and performed a left lower extremity\\nangiogram.  This showed patent SFA, popliteal, and tibial \\nvessels\\ndown into the foot. At this point, we were satisfied with the\\nresults of the intervention and thus elected to terminate the\\nprocedure. Therefore the ___ Prolene was tied down to close the\\narteriotomy in the common femoral artery and the groin was then\\nclosed in 3 layers with ___ Vicryl.  The skin was closed with\\nstaples and a dry sterile dressing was applied.  \\n\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no\\nimmediate complications.  Dr. ___ was present for all\\nportions of the case.  The patient was then transferred to\\nthe ___ care unit in good condition.\\n\\n___.\\n \\nName:  ___              ___ No:  ___']\n",
